//--------------------------------------------
// Implement the Facebook "Like" functionality in Angular

// 1. Create a component/Typescript class that encapsulates data for the like button
// 2. Include the number of likes and whether the button is in the on/off state
// 3. Component should respond to user actions:
        // a. When user clicks "Like", number of likes should increase and button should be in the "on" state
        // b. When user clicks again, number of likes should decrease and button should be in the "off" state
// 4. Display the number of likes whether button is on or off in the console
// 5. Define the class in a separate module, but use it in the main module

export class Like {
    constructor() {
        
    }
}
