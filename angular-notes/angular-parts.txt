Building Blocks of Angular
-------------------------------------

1. What is a component?

- Every Angular application has 1 or more components
- Components encapsulate the data, the HTML template, and the Logic of a View (what users see)
- A website is a component made up of smaller, more maintainable components
- Angular embraces component-based architecture
- Every application has at least 1 component, which we call AppComponent or RootComponent
- An angular app is a tree of components, starting from the root component

2. What is a module?

- A module is a container for a group of related components
- Every angular app has at least 1 module called AppModule
- As our application grows, we may want to break our modules into smaller, more maintainable modules
- In Udemy example, we can have a module conataining all the course components or messaging components
- Each module is responsible for a specific area of our application
